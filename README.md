remoteStorage Dev Kit
=====================

This dev kit is the quickest way to get started with remoteStorage app
development. It gives you a local remoteStorage server and a Hello World app as
your starting point.

In order to run the example server, you need
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) with NPM installed.

First, install the dependencies with:

    npm install

Then you can run the whole example, consisting of both a remoteStorage server
and a Web server for the example app, with:

    sudo node dev-kit

The output will tell you the ports of both the remoteStorage server and the Web
server for the example app.
